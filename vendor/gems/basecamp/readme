= Using the Basecamp API with Ruby

This is the basecamp wrapper provided by 37Signals to access their API with a little change to obtain the API token.

This is useful when you only have username/password and you want to obtain the token automatically to use that in future calls.

= Usage

>> Basecamp.establish_connection!('<subdomain>.basecamphq.com', <username>, <password>, true)
>> Basecamp.get_token
=> "the token"
